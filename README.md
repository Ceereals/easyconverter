# Easyconverter
Easyconverter is a useful site that lets you convert number in differents bases (currently 4, binary/hexadecimal/decimal/octal). It also has an Hamming Code generator (4,7) that i've done for a school project and that now i'm sharing with all of you. I wrote every line of code, and some help was given by my classmates Fralini and Vasile Peste (Sirvasile in github community, he's very smart, generous and willing to help. https://github.com/Sirvasile), by the way i'm new with javaScript and Css coding, i'm actually learnig. Thanks for the time,

Enjoy!
