# Easyconverter
Easyconverter is a usefull site that let you convert number in differents bases (actually 4, binary/hexadecimal/decimal/octal).
It also has an Hamming Code generator (4,7), that i've done for a school project and now i share with all of you.
I wrote every lines of code, some help was given by classmates Fralini and Vasile Peste (Sirvasile in github community, he's a very smart and generous, he can help you. https://github.com/Sirvasile), but the way i'm new with javaScript and Css coding, i'm actually learnig.
Thanks for the time,

Enjoy!
